        <h1>Introduction: Student Stress Level Labeling Task</h1>
        <p>
            Your goal is to determine the stress level of students based on self-reported survey responses.
            <br>
            Each survey asked about 20 factors of stress, split into 5 scientifically identified 
            stress categories with 4 factors each. 
            <br><br>
            The "<span style="color: rgb(236, 0, 43);">Anxiety Level</span>", 
            "<span style="color: rgb(236, 0, 43);">Depression</span>", and 
            "<span style="color: rgb(236, 0, 43);">Self Esteem</span>" factors are measured through the 
            <strong>PHQ-9 assessment tool</strong> (higher means more symptoms of depression), 
            <strong>GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scale</strong> (higher means higher anxiety), 
            and <strong>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale</strong> (higher is higher self esteem) respectively.
            <br>
            The "<span style="color: rgb(236, 0, 43);">Mental Health History</span>" factor is a 
            <strong>binary</strong> value indicating if there is a history of 
            mental health problems (1) or no history (0).
            <br>
            The "<span style="color: rgb(236, 0, 43);">Blood Pressure</span>" factor was subjectively 
            rated on a scale where <strong>1 = low</strong>, <strong>2 = average</strong>, and 
            <strong>3 = high</strong>.
            <br>
            All of the rest of the factors are rated on a Likert scale from 
            0 to 5, where <strong>0 is not applicable</strong>, <strong>1 is low</strong>, and <strong>5 is high</strong> (opposite for reversed valence).
            <br><br>
            You will see 20 students’ rating responses on the stress-related factors.
            <br>
            For each student, label their overall stress level as 
            <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, or <strong>High</strong>.
            <br><br>
            These instructions will be included in a dropdown box at the top of each question page.
